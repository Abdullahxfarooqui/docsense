# 🎯 DEPTH ENFORCEMENT - QUICK REFERENCE

## ✅ What Was Fixed

**Problem**: Shallow, vague, chatbot-style responses
**Solution**: Research-grade prompts + enhanced parameters + validation

---

## 🔧 Key Changes

### 1. Prompt Construction
```python
# OLD (Generic)
"Provide a detailed answer with citations"

# NEW (Research-Grade)
"""
You are a professional AI research assistant.

**Response Rules (Mandatory):**
1. Depth — Write 700-1200 tokens of detailed explanation
2. Structure — Introduction, Key Insights, Analytical Discussion, Conclusion
3. Evidence — Every point must include [Source X] citations
4. Reasoning — Explain like a researcher writing a paper
5. No summaries — Expand and connect ideas deeply
6. Professional, academic tone
"""
```

### 2. Model Parameters
```python
# Enhanced for depth
temperature=0.7              # Was 0.6 - more creative reasoning
max_tokens=3500              # Was 3000 - more space
presence_penalty=0.4         # Was 0.1 - force diversity
frequency_penalty=0.2        # Reduce repetition
```

### 3. Validation
```python
# Automatic depth checking
if word_count < 400 (detailed) or < 200 (brief):
    logger.warning("Response too short")
    
if structure_markers < 2:
    logger.warning("Missing structured sections")
```

## 📊 Expected Outputs

### Detailed Mode (Default)
- **Length**: 700-1200 tokens (400+ words)
- **Structure**: 4 sections
  - Introduction
  - Key Insights / Findings
  - Analytical Discussion
  - Conclusion
- **Citations**: [Source 1], [Source 2], etc.
- **Tone**: Research analyst, not chatbot
- **Depth**: Expand ideas, connect concepts, explain thoroughly

### Brief Mode
- **Length**: 400-600 tokens (200+ words)
- **Structure**: 2-3 focused paragraphs
- **Citations**: Where relevant
- **Tone**: Insightful but concise

---

## 🧪 Test Prompts

### Should Trigger Detailed Mode
- "Analyze the key findings"
- "Tell me about this document in detail"
- "Discuss the implications of X"
- "Compare and contrast A and B"
- "Explain the reasoning behind Y"

### Should Use Brief Mode
- "What is the main topic?"
- "Who is the author?"
- "When was this published?"

### Should Skip Retrieval
- "hey"
- "thanks"
- "ok"

## 🎯 Quality Checklist

For every detailed response, verify:
- [ ] 400+ words (700+ tokens)
- [ ] Has Introduction section
- [ ] Has Key Insights/Findings section
- [ ] Has Analytical Discussion section
- [ ] Has Conclusion section
- [ ] Citations present ([Source X])
- [ ] No "based on the provided context" phrases
- [ ] Paragraph-style (not bullet lists)
- [ ] Research-analyst tone

---

## 🔍 Validation Logs

Check terminal for:
```
✅ Response validated: 650 words
⚠️ Response too short: 150 words (minimum 400)
⚠️ Response lacks structured sections
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

**File**: `document_mode.py`

```python
# Lines 34-39: Parameters
DETAILED_MAX_TOKENS = 3500
RAG_TEMPERATURE = 0.7
PRESENCE_PENALTY = 0.4
FREQUENCY_PENALTY = 0.2

# Lines 395-500: Prompt construction
# Lines 430-462: Validation logic
# Lines 507-590: Enhanced streaming
```
