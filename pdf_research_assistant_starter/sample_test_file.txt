Research Assistant Test Document

This is a sample text file to test the multi-format document support in our Research Assistant application.

Key Features:
- The application now supports both PDF and TXT file formats
- Uses OpenRouter API for enhanced AI responses
- Provides semantic search across multiple document types
- Maintains proper source citations for all answers

Technical Implementation:
The system uses PyMuPDF for PDF processing and standard text reading for TXT files. All documents are chunked using LangChain's text splitters and stored in ChromaDB for efficient vector-based retrieval.

Testing Instructions:
1. Upload this TXT file along with any PDF documents
2. Ask questions about the content
3. Verify that the system properly identifies sources from both file types
4. Check that the OpenRouter API integration provides accurate responses

Sample Questions to Test:
- What file formats does the Research Assistant support?
- How does the system process different document types?
- What API does the application use for AI responses?

This document serves as a comprehensive test case for validating the multi-format document processing capabilities of our upgraded Research Assistant system.
