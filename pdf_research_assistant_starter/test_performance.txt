Performance Test Document

This document is designed to test the optimized search performance and accessibility features of the Research Assistant application.

Key Features to Test:
1. Fast search response times - should be under 3 seconds
2. Improved contrast for better readability 
3. Optimized text rendering with proper fonts
4. Enhanced progress indicators during search
5. Streamlined embedding-free search process

Search Performance Improvements:
- Removed slow embedding model downloads
- Implemented direct ChromaDB text search
- Added intelligent fallback mechanisms
- Optimized query processing pipeline
- Enhanced caching for repeated queries

Accessibility Enhancements:
- WCAG-compliant color contrast ratios
- Dark mode support for better visibility
- Improved font rendering with system fonts
- Better line spacing and readability
- Enhanced metadata display formatting

Test Questions:
- What performance improvements were implemented?
- How was accessibility enhanced?
- What search optimizations were added?
- What are the main features being tested?

This document contains sufficient content to validate that both the search performance and visual accessibility issues have been properly resolved.
