**Before**: Shallow, vague, generic chatbot-style responses
**After**: Deep, structured, research-analyst-grade responses with 700-1200 tokens

---

## 📋 What Was Changed

### 1️⃣ Enhanced Prompt Construction

**File**: `document_mode.py:395-500`

#### **System Message - Detailed Mode**
```python
system_message = """You are **DocSense**, a professional AI research assistant built on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Your purpose is to **analyze, interpret, and reason deeply** over the provided document context.

🧾 **Response Rules (Mandatory):**
1. **Depth** — Write at least *700 to 1200 tokens* of detailed, paragraph-style explanation.
2. **Structure** — Divide the answer into clear, readable sections:
   • **Introduction** (overview and intent)
   • **Key Insights / Findings** (core information from context)
   • **Analytical Discussion** (interpret relationships, implications, or reasoning)
   • **Conclusion** (wrap up with synthesized insight)
3. **Evidence** — Every factual or analytical point **must** include a reference tag like [Source 1], [Source 2].
4. **Reasoning** — Expand and connect ideas. Do not summarize; *explain like a researcher writing a paper*.
5. **Context Sensitivity** — Use only the information derived from the retrieved documents.
   If no relevant context is found, clearly say:
   > "No direct references found in the documents, but based on conceptual inference..."
6. **Style** — Professional, academic, and coherent tone. Avoid bullet summaries unless essential.
7. **Length Enforcement** — Under no circumstances should responses be under 4 paragraphs.
8. **Never say** "based on the provided context" — integrate sources naturally.

This output must sound like a research analyst, not a chatbot. Write expansively with depth."""
```

#### **User Message - Enhanced Instructions**
```python
user_message = f"""
📚 Context Extracted from Documents:
{retrieved_context}

---

User Question:
{query}

---

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
Provide a comprehensive, research-grade analysis following this structure:

**Introduction**
[Set the context and scope — what is this about and why it matters]

**Key Insights / Findings**
[Present the main evidence and facts from the sources with proper citations]

**Analytical Discussion**
[Connect ideas, explain relationships, discuss implications, reason through the material like a researcher]

**Conclusion**
[Synthesize the insights and provide a well-reasoned summary]

Remember: 
- Write 700–1200 tokens total
- Cite sources as [Source X]
- Expand each section fully with substantive, paragraph-style content
- Explain like a research analyst writing a paper, not a chatbot
- If context is insufficient, state it clearly and provide conceptual reasoning
"""
```

### 2️⃣ Model Parameter Optimization

**File**: `document_mode.py:34-39, 545-560`

```python
# Updated parameters for depth
DETAILED_MAX_TOKENS = 3500      # Increased from 3000 for full reasoning space
RAG_TEMPERATURE = 0.7           # Increased from 0.6 for better creativity
PRESENCE_PENALTY = 0.4          # Increased from 0.1 for diverse vocabulary
FREQUENCY_PENALTY = 0.2         # Maintained to reduce repetition

# LLM call with enhanced parameters
stream = self.client.chat.completions.create(
    model=self.model_name,
    messages=messages,
    temperature=0.7,              # Balanced reasoning depth
    max_tokens=3500,              # Ample space for elaboration
    top_p=0.9,                    # Nucleus sampling
    frequency_penalty=0.2,        # Avoid repetition
    presence_penalty=0.4,         # Encourage diversity and depth
    stream=True
)
```

### 3️⃣ Response Depth Validation

**File**: `document_mode.py:430-462`

```python
def validate_response_depth(self, response: str, detail_level: str) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    """Validate if response meets minimum depth requirements."""
    word_count = len(response.split())
    
    if detail_level == 'detailed':
        # Minimum 400 words (roughly 700+ tokens)
        if word_count < 400:
            return (False, f"Response too short: {word_count} words (minimum 400)")
        
        # Check for structure markers (at least 2 section headings)
        structure_markers = response.count('**') // 2
        if structure_markers < 2:
            return (False, "Response lacks structured sections")
    
    elif detail_level == 'brief':
        # Brief responses should still be substantive (at least 200 words)
        if word_count < 200:
            return (False, f"Response too short: {word_count} words (minimum 200)")
    
    return (True, "Response meets depth requirements")
```

### 4️⃣ Enhanced Query Detection

**File**: `document_mode.py:407-428`

```python
# Added more research triggers
research_triggers = [
    'analyze', 'discuss', 'compare', 'contrast', 'evaluate',
    'explain in detail', 'comprehensive', 'in depth', 'thoroughly',
    'what are the implications', 'how does', 'why does',
    'describe the relationship', 'what factors', 'reasoning behind',
    'pros and cons', 'advantages and disadvantages', 'strengths and weaknesses',
    'tell me about', 'elaborate', 'detail'  # NEW additions
]
```

## 📊 Expected Output Comparison

### Before (Shallow Response)
```
The document discusses climate change. It mentions rising temperatures and 
environmental impacts. Several factors are involved. [Source 1]

In conclusion, climate change is a serious issue that needs attention.
```
**Word count**: ~30 words
**Depth**: Superficial
**Structure**: None

### After (Research-Grade Response)
```
**Introduction**
Climate change represents one of the most pressing environmental challenges 
of our time, encompassing a complex interplay of atmospheric, oceanic, and 
terrestrial systems. The documents reveal a multifaceted phenomenon driven 
by both anthropogenic and natural factors, with far-reaching implications 
for ecosystems, economies, and human societies [Source 1].

**Key Insights / Findings**
The primary evidence points to a measurable increase in global mean temperatures 
of approximately 1.2°C since pre-industrial times, with accelerated warming 
observed in the past four decades [Source 1]. This warming trend correlates 
strongly with rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, which have surpassed 
410 parts per million—levels not seen in over 800,000 years [Source 2]. The 
documents detail several feedback mechanisms, including ice-albedo effects 
and methane release from thawing permafrost, which amplify the initial warming 
signal [Source 3].

**Analytical Discussion**
The relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and temperature rise is 
well-established through both empirical observation and climate modeling. 
What makes this particularly concerning is the non-linear nature of climate 
responses—small changes in forcing can trigger disproportionate shifts in 
regional climate patterns [Source 2]. The documents highlight cascading effects: 
warmer temperatures drive glacial melt, which reduces surface albedo, leading 
to further warming and accelerated ice loss. This positive feedback loop 
represents a critical tipping point in the climate system [Source 1, Source 3].

Moreover, the socioeconomic dimensions cannot be overlooked. Vulnerable 
populations in coastal and arid regions face displacement, food insecurity, 
and increased health risks. The intersection of climate impacts with existing 
inequalities creates compounding vulnerabilities that demand comprehensive 
policy responses [Source 4].

**Conclusion**
In synthesizing these findings, climate change emerges not as a singular 
issue but as a systems-level transformation affecting planetary boundaries. 
The evidence underscores the urgency of mitigation strategies—transitioning 
to renewable energy, enhancing carbon sequestration, and implementing adaptive 
measures to build resilience. The documents collectively argue for immediate, 
coordinated action grounded in scientific understanding and equity principles 
[Source 1, Source 2, Source 4].
```
**Word count**: ~350+ words (700+ tokens)
**Depth**: Research-grade analysis
**Structure**: 4 clear sections with reasoning

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. Casual Input Detection
```python
casual_inputs = ["hi", "hello", "hey", "ok", "thanks", "yo", "bye"]
if query.strip().lower() in casual_inputs or len(query.split()) < 2:
    return "casual"  # Skip deep analysis
```

### 2. Research Depth Auto-Detection
```python
research_triggers = ['analyze', 'discuss', 'compare', 'tell me about', ...]
if any(trigger in query.lower() for trigger in research_triggers):
    detail_level = 'detailed'  # Force research-grade response
```

### 3. Prompt Construction
- **System message**: Sets research-analyst persona
- **User message**: Provides structured instructions with mandatory sections
- **Context**: Formatted with clear separators and source labels

### 4. Generation with Validation
- **Stream response** with enhanced parameters (temp=0.7, max_tokens=3500)
- **Validate depth** after streaming completes
- **Log warnings** if response doesn't meet standards
