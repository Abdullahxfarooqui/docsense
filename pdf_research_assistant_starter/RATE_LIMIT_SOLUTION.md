# ⚠️ Rate Limit Issue - All Free Models Exhausted

## Current Situation

Both API keys have hit the **50 requests/day limit** for free models on OpenRouter:

### API Key 1 (Old)
```
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
```
- Status: ❌ Rate limit exceeded
- Remaining: 0/50 requests
- Reset time: When the daily quota refreshes

### API Key 2 (New - Currently Active)
```
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
```
- Status: ❌ Rate limit exceeded  
- Remaining: 0/50 requests
- Reset time: When the daily quota refreshes

**Error Message:**
```
Rate limit exceeded: free-models-per-day. 
Add 10 credits to unlock 1000 free model requests per day
```

## 🔧 Solutions (Choose One)

### Option 1: Wait for Rate Limit Reset ⏰
**Cost:** Free  
**Time:** Wait until the rate limit resets (check `X-RateLimit-Reset` timestamp)

The rate limit resets at: **1761264000000** (Unix timestamp)
- This converts to: Check OpenRouter dashboard for exact time
- Usually resets daily at midnight UTC

**What to do:**
1. Wait for the reset time
2. Your application will automatically work again
3. No changes needed

---

### Option 2: Add Credits to OpenRouter 💳 (RECOMMENDED)
**Cost:** $10 minimum  
**Benefits:** 
- ✅ 1000 free model requests per day (20x more than free tier)
- ✅ Immediate access
- ✅ Access to better models
- ✅ Faster response times

**How to add credits:**
1. Go to https://openrouter.ai/credits
2. Log in with your account
3. Add at least $10 credits
4. Your API keys will immediately get higher limits

---

### Option 3: Create a New OpenRouter Account 🆕
**Cost:** Free (but limited to 50 req/day again)  
**Steps:**
1. Go to https://openrouter.ai/
2. Sign up with a new email address
3. Generate a new API key
4. Update the `.env` file with the new key:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-new-api-key-here
   ```

**Note:** This gives you another 50 free requests but you'll hit the limit again quickly.

### Option 4: Use a Different API Provider 🔄
Switch to a different LLM provider entirely:

#### A. OpenAI (Official)
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
```
- Cost: Pay-per-use (~$0.002/1K tokens)
- Quality: Excellent
- Setup: Get API key from https://platform.openai.com/

#### B. Anthropic Claude
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# Need to modify code to use Anthropic SDK
```
- Cost: Pay-per-use
- Quality: Excellent for long-form content

#### C. Local Models (Ollama)
```bash
# Install Ollama: https://ollama.ai/
ollama pull llama3
# Point to local endpoint
OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
OPENAI_MODEL=llama3
```
- Cost: Free (runs on your machine)
- Quality: Good, but requires powerful hardware
- Speed: Depends on your GPU/CPU

## 🎯 My Recommendation

**For Production Use:** 👉 **Option 2 - Add $10 credits**

Why?
- ✅ Gets you 1000 requests/day (enough for serious testing)
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ $10 lasts a long time with careful usage
- ✅ No code changes needed
- ✅ Access to all free models on OpenRouter

**For Testing Only:** 👉 **Option 1 - Wait for reset**

Why?
- ✅ Completely free
- ✅ No commitment
- ❌ But you'll keep hitting limits

## 💡 Rate Limit Best Practices

If you add credits or wait for reset:

1. **Use Intent Detection** (Already implemented ✅)
   - Casual greetings don't call the API
   - Saves requests for real questions

2. **Cache Responses** (Consider adding)
   - Store common queries and responses
   - Avoid duplicate API calls

3. **Limit Testing Volume**
   - Test with small documents first
   - Don't process many documents at once

4. **Monitor Usage**
   - Check OpenRouter dashboard regularly
   - Track your request count

## 🚀 Quick Action Steps

### If you want to continue NOW:
1. **Go to https://openrouter.ai/credits**
2. **Add $10 credits**
3. **Refresh your application** (already running)
4. **Start asking questions!**

### If you want to wait:
1. **Check the reset time** at https://openrouter.ai/activity
2. **Come back after the reset**
