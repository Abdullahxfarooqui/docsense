### 3. **Performance Optimization - Groq Cloud**

**Model**: LLaMA 3.3 70B Versatile (Groq)

**Configuration**:
```python
Temperature: 0.65          # Analytical reasoning with controlled creativity
Top-P: 0.9                 # Nucleus sampling
Frequency Penalty: 0.3     # Variety in expression
Presence Penalty: 0.3      # Balanced topic exploration
Max Tokens: 4096           # Research-grade length
Timeout: 30s               # Groq is fast - <2s first token
```

**Retrieval**:
- Top K: 5 chunks (comprehensive context)
- MMR Lambda: 0.65 (balanced relevance vs diversity)
- Chunk Size: 1500 chars (optimal granularity)
- Overlap: 200 chars (continuity)

**Speed**:
- First token: <2 seconds
- Streaming: 500-800 tokens/second
- Full response: 3-6 seconds for detailed answers

---

### 4. **Greeting Handler - No Essay Responses**

**User**: "hi" / "hello" / "hey"  
**Response**: "Hey 👋 You're in **Document Mode** — ask a question about your uploaded files, or switch to Chat Mode for general queries."

- No long-winded explanations
- Clear mode indication
- Action-oriented

---

### 5. **Mode Separation - Zero Overlap**

**Chat Mode**:
- Pure conversational AI (like ChatGPT)
- No document retrieval
- If user asks about documents: "You're in Chat Mode — switch to Document Mode to analyze your uploaded files."
- General knowledge questions answered naturally

**Document Mode**:
- Strict RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)
- Only answers from uploaded documents
- If user asks unrelated questions: "You're in Document Mode — that question isn't related to your uploaded files. Switch to Chat Mode to continue."
- Automatically ingests documents on upload
- Clears old embeddings when new files uploaded

---

### 6. **Citation System - Research-Grade**

**Every factual claim** must cite sources:
- Document chunks: [Source 1], [Source 2], [Source 3]
- Excel sheets: [Sheet 1], [Sheet 2]
- Cross-references: "According to [Sheet 2], this aligns with [Source 1]..."

**Natural Integration**:
❌ Don't say: "Based on the provided context..."  
✅ Do say: "Production rates increased by 15% between Q1 and Q2 [Source 1], driven primarily by Well #7 and Well #12 [Sheet 1]."

---

## 📊 RESPONSE EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Numeric Data Analysis

**User**: "What's the average pressure by location?"

**Response** (Brief Mode - 600 tokens):

The production data reveals significant variation in pressure levels across operational sites [Sheet 1]. Analyzing the dataset of 47 well locations, the average pressure stands at **2,847 PSI**, with a standard deviation of 412 PSI indicating moderate variability across the field [Sheet 1].

**Location-Specific Breakdown**:
- **North Sector**: Average pressure of **3,124 PSI** (9.7% above field average), with Wells N-7, N-12, and N-15 performing consistently above 3,200 PSI [Sheet 1]
- **Central Sector**: **2,756 PSI** average, closely aligned with field baseline
- **South Sector**: **2,661 PSI** average (6.5% below baseline), suggesting potential depletion patterns

The North Sector's higher pressure correlates with newer well installations (2023-2024 vintage) [Source 2], while South Sector wells average 8+ years of operation [Source 2]. This **18% pressure differential** between newest and oldest wells suggests a gradual decline rate of approximately **2.2% annually**, which aligns with industry standards for this formation type [Source 3].

**Recommendation**: Priority monitoring on South Sector wells S-4, S-9, and S-11, which show pressures below 2,400 PSI and may require intervention within 6-8 months based on current decline trajectories [Sheet 1].

### Example 2: Detailed Analysis

**User**: "Analyze the production trends in detail"

**Response** (Detailed Mode - 2500+ tokens):

**Introduction**

The production dataset spans 18 months of operational data from January 2023 through June 2024, encompassing 47 active wells across three geographic sectors [Sheet 1]. This analysis examines output trends, pressure dynamics, and operational efficiency patterns to identify performance drivers and optimization opportunities. The comprehensive review integrates quantitative metrics from production logs [Sheet 1] with operational context from field reports [Source 1, Source 2].

**Key Insights & Findings**

Production volumes demonstrate a **12.8% year-over-year increase** from 2023 to 2024, with total output rising from 286,400 barrels (2023 H1) to 323,100 barrels (2024 H1) [Sheet 1]. This growth contradicts the field's historical 3-5% annual decline trend [Source 2], indicating successful intervention strategies...
